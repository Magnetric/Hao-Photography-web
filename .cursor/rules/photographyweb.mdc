  This is a photography portfolio website.
  Use React with functional components and TypeScript.
  Use Tailwind CSS for all styling and layout.
  Design with a clean, minimal aesthetic that highlights images.
  Components should be small and reusable.
  Avoid inline styles and prefer utility classes.
  All images must include meaningful alt text for accessibility.
  Use responsive layout principles (mobile-first).
  Use semantic HTML elements like <section>, <figure>, and <main>.
  Keep all logic and data-fetching in hooks or utils, not inside components directly.
  Don't use "any" type; prefer explicit typing and interfaces.
  Use absolute imports from the src/ folder.
